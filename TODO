VERSION 1.2.1 and/or later
--------------------------

* Better way to handle user regexes?

* Primary channels: Use select box and/or check if channel is in list at server. 
     
* Consider: Can this plugin be installed without needing webapp? Alternative deb package 
  with a minimal webapp setup, or could this be done by this package?

* Conflict between changes in server.ini and config.xml??? Is it acceptable that
  changes to server.ini have no effect because parameters are overridden? 
  
* Ask if user wants to save changes if trying to leave page. Javascript? 

* Update of channel-list: Update menu
